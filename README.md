A slopegraph visualization I created while an intern with Google's Fusion Table team back in 2012. 

Based on Hamilton Ulmer's d3.js slopegraph, it pulls data from the Fusion Tables API and allows the user to select what data is displayed on the left and right sides of the chart. 

Demo can be seen here:
